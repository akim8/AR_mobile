# AR_mobile

This is a demonstration of AR running in Ionic 4 for mobile devices.

## Running locally

`$ ionic serve`

## Running in an android simulator

1. Make sure you have [JDK 1.8.x](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed. The download requires a login since it is legacy. <!-- http://bugmenot.com/view/oracle.com -->

2. Set the JAVA_HOME environmental variable to JDK 1.8.x for this terminal session.

`` $ export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8` ``
