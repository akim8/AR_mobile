# AR_mobile

This is a demonstration of AR running in Ionic 4 for mobile devices.

## Running on an android device

1. Install the packages

`$ npm install`

2. Make sure you have [JDK 1.8.x](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed. The download requires a login since it is legacy. <!-- http://bugmenot.com/view/oracle.com -->

`` $ export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8` ``
